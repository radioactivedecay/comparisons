# Comparisons of radioactivedecay with other codes

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks that compare decay calculation results
from radioactivedecay to those from other codes.

Currently there are comparisons to:

- Radiological Toolbox v3.0.0: uses ICRP 107 decay data.
- PyNE v0.7.5: uses 191004 ENDSF decay data.

For more details see the Jupyter Notebooks in the ``radiological_toolbox`` and
the ``pyne`` directories in this repo.

To run the comparisons with PyNE, copy the decay dataset files created for
radioactivedecay from PyNE data from
[here](https://github.com/radioactivedecay/datasets/tree/main/pyne) into the
``pyne`` directory of this repo.
